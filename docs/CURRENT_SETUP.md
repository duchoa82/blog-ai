# 🚀 Blog SEO AI Shopify App - Current Setup

## 📋 Current Status

✅ **Frontend**: Deployed and working on Railway  
❌ **Backend**: Not working on Railway (deployment issues)  
✅ **Local Backend**: Working perfectly on localhost:3001  

## 🔧 How to Use Right Now

### Option 1: Use Local Backend (Recommended for Development)

1. **Start the local backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```
   The backend will run on `http://localhost:3001`

2. **Open the frontend**:
   - Visit: `https://exquisite-nature-production.up.railway.app`
   - You'll see a "🚧 Development Mode" indicator
   - The app will automatically use the local backend

3. **Test the Admin API**:
   - Click "🧪 Test Admin API" button
   - This will test the connection to your local backend

### Option 2: Try Railway Backend (May not work)

1. **Test if Railway backend is working**:
   ```bash
   curl https://exquisite-nature-production.up.railway.app/api/health
   ```

2. **If it returns HTML instead of JSON**, the backend isn't running

## 🔐 OAuth Installation

1. **Click "Install App on Shopify"** button
2. **Complete the OAuth flow** on Shopify
3. **Grant permissions** for products, blogs, and content
4. **Test OAuth status** with the "Test OAuth Status" button

## 🛠️ What's Working

- ✅ Shop detection from App Bridge
- ✅ Frontend UI and navigation
- ✅ Local backend API endpoints
- ✅ OAuth flow setup
- ✅ Product fetching (when backend is available)

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **Railway Backend**: Not deploying properly (serving static files instead of Node.js)
- **OAuth**: Needs to be completed first before API calls work
- **Product Data**: Falls back to sample data when backend unavailable

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Complete OAuth installation** first
2. **Use local backend** for development and testing
3. **Fix Railway backend deployment** (ongoing)
4. **Test real product data** once OAuth is complete

## 📱 Testing the App

1. **Dashboard**: Shows development mode and OAuth status
2. **Blogs Page**: Will show real blog data once OAuth is complete
3. **Generate Blog Post**: Will work with real products once connected
4. **Pricing**: Static page, always works

## 🔍 Debugging

- **Check browser console** for API call logs
- **Check local backend logs** for detailed error information
- **Use "Test OAuth Status"** button to check connection
- **Use "Test Admin API"** button to test backend connectivity

---

**Note**: The app is fully functional with the local backend. The Railway backend deployment issue is being resolved, but you can continue development and testing using the local setup.
